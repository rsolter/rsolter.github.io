In my day to day work I'm often asked to determine whether a difference is statistically significant.

  _"I can see the year-over-year changes were positive, but were they significant?"_
  _"Did our marketing campaign result in a significant lift among our target audience?"_

The answer that I give them, and the method that I have used without exception, has been based on a p-value. And I'm not alone. Whether in business or science, p-values are the ubiquitous measuring stick to determine whether an effect is significant and worth attention or funding.
