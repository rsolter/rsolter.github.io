## Forecasting Capital Bikeshare usage with Exponential Smoothing

## Background

I’ve always loved biking. At age 18, I rode my bike 140 miles with a few
friends one summer to Chicago, sleeping outside along the way. At age
29, I took a much less advised trip from DC to NYC on Dec, 28th trying
to make it to Brooklyn in 3 days for a NYE party. It was below freezing
when I began, and I only ended up making to to Baltimore before turning
tail and taking a train back to DC. My passion for biking is one reason
I decided to hunt down some DC bike share data for a post about
forecasting. Also, working with bike share data, is a

## Exponential Smoothing Theory

Exponential smoothing is one of the fundamental methods for forecasting
univariate series. The basic idea behind the method is that forecasts
are produced using a weighted average of past observations. This post
will examine applying exponential smoothing to forecast monthly
ridership on the Capital BikeShare program.

For a simple time series, represented by {*x*<sub>*t*</sub>}, beginning
at *t* = 0, and the forecast of the next value in our sequence
represented as *x̂*<sub>*t* + 1</sub>, the simplest form of exponential
smoothing takes the form:

*x̂*<sub>*t* + 1</sub> = *α**x*<sub>*t*</sub> + *α*(1 − *α*)*x*<sub>*t* − 1</sub> + *α*(1 − *α*)<sup>2</sup>*x*<sub>*t* − 2</sub>..

In the equation above, the rate at which the weights decrease is
determined by the *α*, or the **smoothing factor** which is bound by
0 &lt; *α* &lt; 1. If *α* is closer to 0, more weight is given to
observations from the more distant past, while a value of *α* that is
closer to 1 will give more more weight to recent observations.

This idea can be expanded to different components of a time series, with
each component having its own smoothing factors. The standard way of
breaking apart the series is into three components: the level
*l*<sub>*t*</sub>, trend *b*<sub>*t*</sub>, and seasonal
*s*<sub>*t*</sub> components. This model is known as the **Holt-Winter’s
multiplicative method** and each smoothing factor is estimated on the
basis of minimizing the sum of the square residuals (SSE).

**The overall model**: Where *h* denotes the number of periods forecast
into the future (horizon), *m* denotes the frequency of the seasonality
(m=12 for monthly data), and k represents the integer part of *(h-1)/m*
which ensures that the estimate of the seasonal indices used for
forecasting come from the final year of the sample. Read more about the
Holt-Winters methodology
[here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/holt-winters.html).

*ŷ*<sub>*t* + *h*\|*t*</sub> = (*l*<sub>*t*</sub> + *h**b*<sub>*t*</sub>)*s*<sub>*t* + *h* − *m*(*k* + 1)</sub>

**Level** component, with *a**l**p**h**a* as the smoothing parameter
bound between 0 and 1.

$$ l\_{t} = \\alpha \\frac{y\_{t}}{s\_{t-m}}+(1-\\alpha)(l\_{t-1}+b\_{t-1}) $$

**Trend** component, with *β* as the smoothing parameter bound between 0
and 1.

*b*<sub>*t*</sub> = *β*(*l*<sub>*t*</sub> − *l*<sub>*t* − 1</sub>) + (1 − *β*)*b*<sub>*t* − 1</sub>

**Season** component, with *γ* as the smoothing parameter bound between
0 and 1.

$$ s\_{t} = \\gamma \\frac{y\_{t}}{l\_{t-1}+b\_{t-1}}+(1-\\gamma)s\_{t-m} $$

## Applying Holt-Winters to BikeShare data

As can be seen below, the bike data demonstrates clear seasonality and a
growing trend in overall ridership, so our exponential smoothing model
will need to account for both. Furthermore, the size of the seasonal
swings in ridership have grown over time, meaning our method will need
to account for that as well. Note that the chart below does not include
the final 12 observations in the dataset which have been set aside for
testing model accuracy.

![](/rblogging/2019/10/05/viz-1.png){: .align-center}

Given that the size of the seasonal fluctuations are not constant over
time, the data is likely better fit with a multiplicative method,
however an additive model will be run for comparison:

``` r
add_fit <- hw(train,seasonal="additive",h = 12)
mult_fit <- hw(train,seasonal="multiplicative",h = 12)
autoplot(ts_month) +
  autolayer(add_fit, series="HW additive forecasts", PI=FALSE) +
  autolayer(mult_fit, series="HW multiplicative forecasts",
    PI=FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(label=comma) + theme_minimal() +
  xlab(" ") +
  ylab("Monthly Bike Rentals") +
  ggtitle("Holt-Winters Additive and Multiplicative Methods") +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

It certainly appears that the multiplicative model does a better job
than the additive one in estimating the ridership, at least until the
final few months of the predictive window at which point the two
estimates are quite similar. We can confirm this by looking at the
errors on a monthly basis. Over the 12 months, the mean absolute percent
error for the additive model is 18.5% while the multiplicative method is
closer at 10.1%.

Since the multiplicative forecast appeared to over-estimate ridership in
the second half of the prediction period, we can try and improve the
forecast by adding a damped trend. The damped trend introduced another
parameter to the trend equation that will eventually turn the trend to a
flat line sometime in the future. This is a popular method and often
improves the performance of the model.

Tthe addition of the damped method does improve the model’s performance.
We can see in the plot below the red line hugs the actual ridership much
more closely, and the damped multiplicative method returns a mape of
8.7% as opposed to 10.1% for the undamped, multiplicate method.

## Utilizing ets()

A more general approach to exponential smoothing than Holt-Winters is to
use the `ets()` function which automatically chooses an exponential
smoothing model based upon all all potential combinations of parameters
for error, trend, and seasonality (see more
[here](https://robjhyndman.com/talks/RevolutionR/6-ETS.pdf) on slide
12). The ets framework (error, trend, seasonality) tries out multiple
models and estimates the likelihood that the data gathered could be
generated from those individual models. Final model is chosen based upon
AIC or other fit statistics and accounts for any combination of
seasonality and damping. This is a highly efficient and flexible
approach that I use in my work when producing annual goals for different
hotel performance metrics.

The **model** parameter in the `ets()` function can be specified with a
three character string. The first letter denotes the error type, the
second letter denotes the trend type, and the third letter denotes the
season type. The options you can specify for each component are below:

-   error: additive (“A”), multiplicative (“M”), unknown (“Z”)
-   trend: none (“N”), additive (“A”), multiplicative (“M”), unknown
    (“Z”)
-   seasonality: none (“N”), additive (“A”), multiplicative (“M”),
    unknown (“Z”)

For example, setting `model='AAM'` would produce a model with additive
error, additive trend, and multiplicative seasonality. By default, the
parameter is set to “ZZZ” which passes unknown values to each component
and allows the algorithm to select the ‘optimal’ model. See `ets()`
reference
[here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.12/topics/ets)
and more on comparing to `hw()`,
[here](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/estimation2/).

Running the model with the default setting returns ETS(M,Ad,M):

    ## ETS(M,Ad,M)

    ##  ets(y = train)
    ##

    ##     beta  = 1e-04

Forecasting a year forward with this model provide a much better
prediction, returning an average absolute error of just 4.6%
