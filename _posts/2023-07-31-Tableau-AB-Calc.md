A/B Testing is a standard method for measuring the effects of experimentation for email and web marketing, product analytics, and algorith development.

Some of the common tasks associated with A/B testing is estimating the necessary sample size in each test variation to ensure statisticaly valid results and performing a post-test analysis to measure whether the results are statistically signficant. I've built a Tableau dashboard which these taks in to an easy-to use dashboard - [see here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ravi.solter5174/viz/ABTestingGuide/Home).
