In the past 6 months, I’ve learned a lot more about Tableau as I’ve used
it on a daily basis to create dashboards for my client. I’ve expanded my
basic knowledge to better understand windowing functions, LOD
calculations, and filter actions which have helped raise the functional
bar on the dashboards I build.

To cap off 6 months of more intensive learning, I decided to pursue the
first Tableau Certification – [Tableau Desktop
Specialist](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/8f02c1dc-af75-44ea-8363-d1c09be4ce65/public_url).
While not the most challenging exam, it was a nice validation of my
knowledge, and a first step on the path to more learning and
certifications.

I also celebrated the achievement by creating my first public Tableau
viz which I’ve posted to my online portfolio
[here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/r.solter#!/). The dashboard
itself shows the trends in attendance at the top-flight Italian soccer
league, Serie A. Check out a preview below, and the full dashboard on
the link to my portfolio above.
