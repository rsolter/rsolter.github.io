Below is the record of the courses I have finished during my continuing education in data analytics and data science. Of course, there are few substitutes for what you can learn from practice so Iâ€™ve applied the education to a few projects and blog posts.

  - Udemy: **Data Analysis with Pandas and Python** - [Certificate](/assets/images/Python_Pandas_Cert.jpg)

  - Udemy: **Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp** - [Certificate](/assets/images/Python_DS_Cert.jpg)
