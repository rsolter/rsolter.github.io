I am a data scientist in Washington, DC currently employed at Marriott International. My work primarily focuses on analyzing the performance and setting goals for our Loyalty Program as well as supporting new member acquisition efforts for our various credit cards. I also serve as a scrum master to a team of analysts, engineers, and data scientists.

I have a background in statistics, with a experience in inferential statistics, forecasting, and predictive modeling. I do most of my analysis and modeling in  in R, and increasingly Python. For visualizations and dashboards, I use both Tableau and R libraries ggplot2 and Shiny.

This blog serves as a collection of my projects and learnings in the field of data science and machine learning.
