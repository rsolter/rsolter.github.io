I am a data scientist in Washington, DC currently employed at Marriott International where I serve as a scrum master to a team of data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. My work primarily focuses on analyzing the performance and setting goals for our Loyalty program - Marriott Bonvoy.

I have extensive experience in deriving insights from 100s of millions of rows through using data visualization and building dashboards. I also have a background in statistics, with a experience in predictive modeling, inferential statistics, forecasting, and experimental design. I do my work in R, SQL, and Tableau, and more recently Python.

This blog is meant to serve as a collection of my projects and learnings in the field of data science and machine learning.
