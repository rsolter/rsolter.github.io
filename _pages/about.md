I am a data scientist in Washington, DC currently employed at Marriott International where I serve as a scrum master to a team of data analysts, scientists, and engineers. My work focuses on analyzing the performance and setting goals for our Loyalty program - Marriott Bonvoy.

I have extensive experience in deriving insights from 100s of millions of rows of data using R, SQL, and Tableau, and more recently Python. I also have a background in statistics, with a experience in inferential statistics, forecasting, and experimental design.

This blog is meant to serve as a collection of my projects and learnings in the field of data science and machine learning.
