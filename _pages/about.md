I am a data scientist in Washington, DC currently employed at Marriott International where I serve as a scrum master to a team of data analysts, scientists, and engineers. My work focuses on analyzing the performance and setting goals for our Loyalty program - Marriott Bonvoy.

This blog is meant to serve as a collection of my projects and learnings in the field of data science and machine learning.
